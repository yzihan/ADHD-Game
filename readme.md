### Background

Case intervention practices for children with Developmental Delays (DD) suggest that intervention methods can be implemented in various capacities, such as attention, vision, literacy, auditory, and comprehension, and can be divided into three levels: cognitive-understanding-creation. The ability to discriminate between shapes and background in visual perceptual intervention serves as the entry point for development.

Shape-background discrimination refers to the ability to distinguish an object from the background that surrounds it. Children with deficiencies in this area are unable to distinguish the required items from the visual background, making them susceptible to interference from irrelevant stimuli. This skill is especially crucial for young children when completing reading tasks involving pictures and text, as it enables them to quickly extract valuable information.
